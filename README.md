Proxx

Rules and playable game. Review the rules and familiarize yourself with the game. You donâ€™t
need to implement the flag functionality.
There are three parts to the exercise. For each part, please include a working coded solution
along with an explanation for choosing a certain approach.
Part 1:
Choose a data structure(s) to represent the game state. You need to keep track of the following:
- NxN board
- Location of black holes
- Counts of # of adjacent black holes
- Whether a cell is open

Part 2:
Populate your data structure with K black holes placed in random locations. Note that should
place exactly K black holes and their location should be random with a uniform distribution.

Part 3
For each cell without a black hole, compute and store the number of adjacent black holes. Note
that diagonals also count. E.g.

0 2 H
1 3 H
H 2 1
